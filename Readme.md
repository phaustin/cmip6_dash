# installing

1) install conda-lock

       conda install conda-lock mamba

2) generate a new conda lock file if environment.yml has changed:

       conda-lock -f environment.yml -p linux-64

   or win-64 or macos-64

3) create and activate the new environment:

      mamba create --name dash --file conda-linux-64.lock
      mamba activate dash
      pip install -r requirements.txt

4) start the app and browse localhost:8050

     python app.py

5) to install the pre-commit hooks

     pre-commit install

6) to check in ignoring the pre-commit failures

     git commit --no-verify

## Adding cases

1) Adding a case can be achieved with the following commands

     ``` Python
     write_case_definition(<specifications>),
     with open((case_file_path + <name_of_case_file>)) as f:
          data = json.load(f)
     get_case_data(<specifications>))
     ```

2) After you are happy with the case, the code should be transfered to make_case.py and version controlled.

3) Cases can be regenerated by calling python make_cases.py from the root of the directory
